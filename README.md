As the world begins to travel again, this would help people to chose their perfect vacation spot based on preferences, such as temperatures.  The database created would then allow you to find hotels near that city and help you chose the best city based on maximum temperatures, current weather conditions, and location.

If there are more than one vacation spots that a person would like to visit, an itinerary can be created for the travelers.  This would then let people chose multiple cities that they can drive, bike or walk to.  This would also include a map, which tells them the best route to take to get to all of the cities.
